As a user,

When I open the app...
  -I am presented with the (title, brief description, time-blocks, and the current date> Moment.js)

When I inspect the page...
  -I notice that the color of the text-entry field changes colors depending on the current hour

When I click on the text box...
  -I am able to input some sort of text

When I click on the "save button"...
  -My text entry is saved to local storage and still displayed when I refresh the page
