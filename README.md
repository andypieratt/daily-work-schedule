# daily-work-schedule

## Objective

The goal of this challenge was to create a 'daily-scheduler' application that allows users to store important to-do items for a typical work day ranging from 9AM - 5PM. We were tasked with using open libararies like Bootstrap and Moment.js to dynamically change the look and layout of our page.

## How I Achieved This

I am pretty happy with how my application turned out. The only flaw that I couldn't really get around with my current code is making the hours of the day not in military time and still maintain functionality.

We began this assignment with some starter code so the beginnings of the layout were already there. I decided to start with a quick-win and used my Moment.js knowledge to add the "currentDay" variable to the header section by creating that Javascript function. After that, I went through about four or five variations of my intended time-block section. Once I recieved some guidance from my tutor, we decided the best way to do the time-block section was to create it dynamically with Javascript. Once that was done, I used some "if" statements to create the color-coding functionality as the hours change. Once the color-coding was done, I worked with my tutor to engrain the principles of local storage into my memory and I created the functionality that stores and retrieves user inputs when they interact with the text-field.

## How This Applies to My Career

This assignment really challenged and pushed me in a lot of ways. We began working with open-source libraries that make coding a bit easier, but still require a lot of work and attention to detail. Moment.js was very fun to use because it added "date and time" functions to the page which is very useful in a lot of ways going forward... same thing with the Bootstrap library as well. I looked forward to continuing to create dynamically changing applications that serve a purpose of bettering the user experience on the web.
